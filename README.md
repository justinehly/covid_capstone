### Purpose
The purpose of this study is to investigate  key features to help create an understanding for the public and help show preventive measures. This study focuses on the exploration of feature selection through building multiple models, one simple linear model, one more complex model, and an average of the two for prediction on inpatient hospitalization rates.
